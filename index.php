 <h3>About Me!</h3>
 <img src="images/tablet.jpg" class="tablet" alt="" />
 <p>Hello!
<br>
My name is Tamerica Hyatt, although I go by "T" usually.
<br>
<br>
I haven't taken classes since last Spring, so I'm a little bit rusty on the coding stuff. Hopefully I'll get back into the swing of things, quickly, though!
<br>
I live in Seattle, at the top of Queen Anne hill.
<br>
For fun I like to exercise and draw, as well as take care of my pet Senegal parrot, Mateo! I am 29-years-old and he is 23-years-old, so we're both millenials!
<br>
<br>
One of the things I'd love to get better at in this class involves designing web pages that look good on multiple devices. In my previous course, we touched on that a bit but I'm still not too sure of myself when it comes to writing the code required for that.
<br>
My goal is to develop the skills to become a freelance designer.
